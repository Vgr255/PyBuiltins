# PyBuiltins
This module is a collection of pure Python implementations
of built-in functions and types. It is not meant to replace
the 'builtins' module, but more as a way to have the most
possible functions made in pure Python (for introspection),
and also as a way to show some people how most built-in
functions behave.
